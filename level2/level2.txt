1. What is the DOM?
- The DOM is the "Document Object Model". 
  It give us as developers the chance to modify objects in html documents.

2. List three methods to manipulate the DOM.
- createElement()
    example: var newLi document.createElement('li');
    
- style.list-style:
    example: newUl.style.list-style = 'none';
    
- querySelector()
    example: document.querySelector('li');
    
3. What is an asynchronous call?
- An asynchronous call is a method to make a call while the rest of the program is loading. 
The code will not wait for the server to answer before executing.

4. Briefly explain what the sources tab in Chromes Developers Tools does.
- The sources tab lets you set breakpionts and blackboxes in your code while debugging. 
You can also set Event listener breakpoints that will stop the code from running on 
trigger and highlight the code for you. 
There is much more you can do, but this is a brief.

5. What is a JavaScript promise?
- A promise is a way to let asynchronous code return a value. It can have three states: 
    "rejected" : Failed 
    "pending" : State not set yet
    or "fulfilled" : Successful
    
6. What is an API?
- An API can be a way to connect/communicate with web-services.
  YouTube for example has an Analytics API where you can get your channels Analytics data.
  API stands for "Application Programming Interface" (was about to say Protocol there.)
  
7. What is a JavaScript Event?
- A JavaScript Event is a way for JS to interact with you HTML page.
  You can add a function on a button and make this pop up as an alert as we did in Level1, q1.
  
8. What is event bubbling?
- Event bubbling is the order event handlers are called when nested.
